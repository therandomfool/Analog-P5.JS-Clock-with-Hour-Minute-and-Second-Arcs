# Analog P5.JS Clock with Hour, Minute and Second Arcs

- push() to add new second, minute, hour placement

- pop() to drop the old hands position to make the hand look like a ticking clock

- arc() for hand placement based on newest hand placement

- used array to represent month name rather than month number

- uses the second 'sc' variable to animate time and date text opposite directions  

- Animation returns to starting point when seconds go from 60 to 1

- nf() to set display to show 2 places for text time, and day i.e. display 06:37:04 rather than 6:37:4 or 06 June 2020 rather than 6 June 2020
